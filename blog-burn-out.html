                                Man. As I graduate, I realize how messed up this entire 'american university culture' has affected
                                my mental. Part of it is satisfying; the endless all-nighter, the companionship, the general
                                suffering, the triumph of surviving an extra day.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I can't lie. I did learn a lot from the constant struggle. You might say I could have decided to
                                have an 'easier time', but that's not how this works. Competitiveness in the marketplace,
                                considering how good your resume will look from your first year. It's impossible not to consider
                                those in mind. 4 years. 8 semesters. 4 summers. Every possible break is an opportunity to add
                                something new. Every semester is a chance to build your teaching and research experience. A full
                                semester of courses is around 50 hours/week. To be able to afford my daily coffees (just 6, not that
                                much), I need to work 20h/week as a course assistant. Unfortunately, this is not enough, you have to
                                consider an extra 10 hours/week of research, readings, self-learning.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The equation adds up to a healthy 80h/week. Basically, a very reasonable amount of hours for a 20
                                years old to function. This work expectation while trying to keep a semblant of socializing in your
                                daily schedule. Sleep becomes fourth on the priority list. Most of my early years, I would sleep on
                                campus to save on money and time. Precious seconds. To be fair, a minute is enough to make a
                                difference between you submitting on time or getting a 25% grade penalty.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                How sustainable is this lifestyle? Spoiler alert. Not very. My semesters have been ups and downs,
                                and I'd like to think it's not necessarily <em>just</em> because of my diagnosis -which I might talk
                                about in future posts. You can be high-achieving and suffer the ultimate demise of
                                <strong>burn-out</strong>. All of a sudden, the passion that made me survive all this over-working
                                could not be found anymore. It's like 'what's the point anymore?'. Research I focused on for two
                                years just seems like I wouldn't dare to poke it with 10 meters stick.. and when there's no passion,
                                motivation dies down.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                'You should find the motivation yourself, it does not appear magically!' Fair, but also too
                                simplistic. I think, as most people who chose computer science as their field, there is this
                                collective interest and fascination with the subject. The usual 'look it works!!' deal. When you
                                lose this interest and fascination, you're just left with confusion. And it's not like taking a
                                break is an option. Remember, it's about consistency, not understanding. You get overwhelmed by 1001
                                assignments every week. Acing exams? Doesn't matter. You missed that one lab, 2 months ago. You are
                                'objectively' inferior.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                American education. After four years, you'd think I would have gotten used to it. However, I'm at a
                                stage where I can't tell if this is the norm, or if it's just particularly intense at my
                                institution. The competitive environment, the constant pressure to perform, the fear of falling
                                behind - it all becomes a cycle that's hard to break free from.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What I've learned is that recognizing burnout is the first step. It's not a personal failing or a
                                sign of weakness. It's a natural response to an unsustainable system. The challenge is finding ways
                                to navigate through it while maintaining your sense of self and your genuine love for learning.
