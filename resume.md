Education
---------

2023-2025 (excepted)
:   **Master en Rercherche Informatique**; Ecole Polytechnique, Paris

    *Projet M1 on Graphical Algebra and its applications to Category Theory, implementation in Agda, advised by Samuel Mimram*
    *Stage M1 with Partout on an implementation of proof search for Pomset and BV logic, advised by Lutz Straßburger* \ 

2018-2022
:   **B.S., Computer Science**; Carnegie Mellon University

    *Honors Thesis: Domain Informed Oracle for Reinforcement Learning, advised by Giselle Reis, Gianni Di Caro and Eduardo Feo Flushing* \ 
    *Concentration in Programming Languages*


Experience
----------

**Course Assistant for Constructive Logic (15-317) and Artificial Inteligence (15-281) @ CMU Qatar:**

Provided 1-1 tutoring to provide students with weekly helped, made autograders for the programming sections of the homeworks, wrote guidelines and reviewed midterms and assignments. 

**Teaching Assistant for Software Foundations of Security and Privacy (15-316) @ CMU Pittsburgh and Qatar:**
Proctored examinations, met weekly with the teaching staff to better adapt grading and wordings. In Qatar, I wrote the homework solutions for future iterations of the course.


**Undergraduate Research Assistant @ CMU Qatar:**
Funded by Giselle Reis. 
Implemented a theorem prover for classical and constructive logic where the underlying types are objects. The prover was later automated for classical by making use of G3CP invertible rules. The project has an easy-to-use graphical interface to be used by students learning about logic. 

**Java Instructor @ CMU Africa:**
Taugh Computer Science teachers basics of Java, by designing 2-week curriculum. Met with President Paul Kagame to discuss the future of education in Rwanda. The project was done by closely working with CMU Pittsburgh and CMU Africa. 


Research Experience
--------------------

**Domain Informed Oracle for Reinforcement Learning (dio):**
* Implemented a domain-informed module in ProgLog to guide the reward shaping of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) module 
* Independently gathered related work to better identify the problem of reward shaping in RL and investigate possible solutions
* Adapted a deep-learning architecture to include a logic module, the model was formalized accordingly 
* [link](main.pdf) 

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
