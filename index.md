Due to the lack of presence on social media, I figured a blog would be better to confirm that I am indeed a real person, a reasonable one at that (or at least I hope so). 
I might randomly ramble at given points, expect french or english writings depending on the weather. 

Couple of things about me: 
- Computer Science B.S. w/ Concentration in Programming Languages
- Into formal verification, logic programming & proof theory 
- Reinforcement Learning & Symbolic AI believer 
- Dungeons & Dragons Enjoyer
